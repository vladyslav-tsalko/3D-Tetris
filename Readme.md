# 3D Tetris (WebGL)

A 3D Tetris game implemented in **JavaScript** with **WebGL**.  
Rotate, translate, and drop TetraCubes in a 3D grid space with real-time lighting and perspective/orthographic camera views.

## üöÄ Features

- **3D TetraCubes**: Includes I, O, L, T, N, Tripod, Tower shapes.
- **WebGL Rendering**: Uses shaders for lighting and color.
- **Keyboard Controls** for movement, rotation, and camera.
- **Perspective and Orthographic Views** with smooth switching.
- Dynamic lighting with vertex and fragment shaders.
- OBJ parser for loading 3D models.
